                <p class='privacy-policy'><span class='privacy-policy-bold'>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</span>
                Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet.

                We have implemented the following:
                Remarketing with Google AdSense
                We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.

                When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
                We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
                Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</p>

                <p class='privacy-policy'><span class='privacy-policy-bold'>Fair Information Practices</span>
                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
                In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
                We will notify you via email: Within 7 business days.<br>
                We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

We use the Advertiser's supplied e-mail and postal addresses for the purpose of assisting that particular Advertiser.Hashed email addresses: If an Advertiser allows, we may collect hashed versions of the emails that are entered on that Advertisers site. These hashed emails are used as an additional identifier to help us better target ads for Advertisers, including across multiple devices or browsers.We use this data to help our Advertisers identify and serve ads to you that are more relevant to you. We also use this data to operate, improve and enhance our services including enhancing the data points we or our Advertising Partners have about a particular user, browser, or device, or to target, optimize, cap, or synchronize advertising.</p>
